## EDUCATION FOR THE STUDENTS, BY THE STUDENTS 
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
According to the report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), 32 million Indian children of age up to 13 years have never attended any school, the majority of them belonging to the socially disadvantaged class (2014).

### OUR SOLUTION
Design a website which promotes education of under-privileged kids in India. We use this platform to bring together volunteers. The focus is on mobilizing the community through localized campaigns, sensitization meetings involving existing community-level institutions, creating awareness about the entitlements of children and helping vulnerable families.We plan to integrated an event recommender system on our website. The model is popularity and collaborative filtering based which recommends events to users who have skills to be a volunteer in that particular camp.This has been done in order to increase the enthusiasm and participation of volunteers.

Our platform will support a huge number of under-privileged kids and help them in obtaining basic education along with learning essential skills. This website will be reliable, secure and robust and would contribute in decreasing the education gap between the rich and the poor. We also wish to add a section to showcase  achievements of our students which would in turn motivate more students & volunteers to join in.
